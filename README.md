# Customer_segmentation-
# Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial practice in marketing and business strategy that involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups, each of which shares certain characteristics that are relevant to marketing, such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits. One of the popular techniques used for customer segmentation is the K-means clustering algorithm, which is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups data points into K clusters based on similarities in their features.

In this project, we utilize the K-means algorithm to perform customer segmentation based on two essential features: annual income and spending score. By leveraging these features, we aim to identify distinct groups of customers with similar spending behaviors and financial capacities. This segmentation can enable businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and offerings to different customer groups, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and overall business profitability.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of customer information, including annual income and spending score. These attributes provide valuable insights into customers' purchasing behaviors and financial capabilities, allowing us to effectively segment the customer base. The dataset has been preprocessed to ensure data quality and reliability for accurate clustering analysis.

# Methodology
We employ the K-means clustering algorithm to categorize customers into different segments based on their annual income and spending score. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to one of K clusters based on the similarity of features, aiming to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares. By finding the optimal number of clusters and running the algorithm, we can effectively group customers with similar income and spending patterns, facilitating targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
